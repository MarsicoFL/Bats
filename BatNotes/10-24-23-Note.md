We should consider primary objectives here before embracing fancy sequencing. Beside pangenomics, what were other major objectives? Do we still qualify for that?  
Contribution to ref seq: we have one sample out for ONT ultra-long read sequencing, shall we pause experiments until we are sure about it? 

The obvious analysis here would be admixture deconvolution, except we dont have sequence data for it. We can generate cheap low pass sequences and do it (https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/210/2/719/5931101?login=true#397963589). Would this be feasible?
Meanwhile, we can use what we have, i.e. mtDNA to try to infer population size and growth (http://beast.community/about): half of the story, possibly biased toward sexual selection, but still informative. Probably try to include other species mtDNA (where can we get the data from?).
