Detailed Timeline

    1. 1988: The Erlangen colony is established with Glossophaga bats from Mexico, identified as Glossophaga mutica according to today’s standards. These bats were housed in a greenhouse, cohabiting with Leptonyteris curasoae and Choeronycteris mexicana, two very distinct glossophagine species.

    2. Decades Following 1988:
        Additional Glossophaga individuals were imported from various South American locations, including Glossophaga soricina antillarum, Glossophaga commissarisi, and Glossophaga soricina from Venezuela.
        The Venezuelan bats were housed in a separate greenhouse, situated 200 meters away from the Mexican bats, and cohabited with a small group of G. s. antillarum.
        A single individual of Glossophaga longirostris was present in the colony, cohabiting with other species. This bat was notable for its larger body size, never reproduced, and does not belong to the “soricina” complex.

    3. Unknown Date (but likely before the colony was dissolved):
        Glossophaga soricina antillarium and Glossophaga soricina (cf.) were housed together but remained clearly distinguished and separate from each other within the housing.
        There might have been an import of a separate group of individuals from Venezuela, initially kept separate. These bats could have been true Glossophaga soricina from western South America. Further investigation would be needed to confirm details about this group.
        Glossophaga commissarisi was always kept as a separate group in a separate enclosure, without cohabiting with other species.

    4. Approximately 15 Years Ago (around 2008): The Erlangen colony was dissolved. From this point onwards, the separation of the different Glossophaga lineages was not maintained. The lineage of the greenhouse-Glossophaga became uncertain, potentially resulting in a mix of Glossophaga from Mexico and Venezuela.
