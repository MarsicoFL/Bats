## Relatedness beyond generations
We are investigating a population of 105 bats divided into two distinct colonies. Interestingly, these groups share a common ancestor dating back at least 8 generations. 
Each of the colonies was initially founded with a set of 5 males and 5 females, who were either siblings or cousins. 
Through computational simulations,  we analyze the possible kinship relationships among the individuals within these bat colonies.

## Can two individuals share DNA for a common ancestor after 7 or more generations?
Lets do the experiment, based on this methodology: https://github.com/MarsicoFL/ibdsim2

We analyze the following example:

After simulations of possible genomes (2000) for individuals 26 and 38. We obtain:

How much they share? Most of the cases share zero, or just a few centimorgans of genome.

## But, if we have inbreeding?
Considering the information that we have at the moments, most of bats came from a common ancestor beyond 7 generations. So, at least the first generations should have been inbreeding. Here a conceptual case is presented.
