## Relatedness beyond generations
We are investigating a population of 105 bats divided into two distinct colonies. Interestingly, these groups share a common ancestor dating back at least 8 generations. 
Each of the colonies was initially founded with a set of 5 males and 5 females, who were either siblings or cousins. 
Through computational simulations,  we analyze the possible kinship relationships among the individuals within these bat colonies.

## Could two individuals share DNA for a common ancestor after 7 or more generations?
