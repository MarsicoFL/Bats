## Pop gen analyses

Just remembering, we obtained more relatedness within colonies than between them:

Analyzing the same with other plots:

Firstly, considering the 105 bats, analyzing the RNA-seq data (curated variants) we perform PCA analysis.
The following scree plot is obtained.

There is no clear kick point. We proceed plotting two or three major components:

We observe some separation between colonies, but not enough to declare a clear clustering. Also, we analyze FST, below the results:

In concordance with PCA, and with kinship results, we observe low population structure.
